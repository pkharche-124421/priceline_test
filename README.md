# priceline_test

Hi,

I have attempted the Priceline test app in following way:
1. Kotlin
2. Architecture used: MVVM
3. One activity and 2 fragments. 1st fragment displays "names" from Name.api and
other shows "books" from list.api for particular entry selected
4. With respect to 2nd api, the api doesn't provide any output for any entry selected as per document.
Therefore for purpose of working module, I have hard coded the api example.
The dynamic api parameter call is commented
5. For api calling Retrofit and Coroutines are used
